# ian Library Documentation

The `ian` library is a set of fine-tuned front-end components developed by [Jan Kuƒça](http://jankuca.com). The main advantage of the library is that it is compilable in the `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS` compilation mode and the `VERBOSE` analysis level via the [Google Closure Compiler](http://developers.google.com/closure/compiler).

Most of the core components are intended to be used in single-page applications. It, however, does often make sense to also use them in classic server-rendered applications or static websites.
